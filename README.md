# save_the_earth

------------------------ Save Your Planet ----------------------
This is the beginning of a website that teaches how pollution is slowly destroying the world, alternatives you can
take to reduce your carbon footprint, read about movements you can support working towards a cleaner world, and add your input 
via comments.

Open the index.html page to reach the homepage of the website.
My functioning javaScript is the slideshow towards the bottom of the page.
